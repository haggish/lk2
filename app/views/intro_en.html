    <p>Kärki is working with poems,

        alienation and being an outsider.
        Loneliness, relatives and friends forgotten in a hurry and incapability

        problems of the contemporary society.</p>

    <h3>Artist Statement</h3>

    <p>I work with word, sight and sound. I am the visual artist, poet, and
        sound designer of
        my artworks. In addition to this I am a craftswoman too, so I let the
        techniques and the
        process of creation be visible in the artworks as a part of them.</p>

    <p>My artworks deal with themes of alienation and being an outsider.
        Loneliness, relatives
        and friends forgotten in a hurry, and incapability for empathy are all
        connected to the social
        problems of the contemporary society.</p>

    <p>I work in Berlin, Lahti, Helsinki and artist residencies abroad. I am
        currently working for my
        exhibitions in 2014 - 2015.</p>

    <h3>On my artistic work</h3>

    <p>In my artistic work, I combine poems, sculptures and a
        variety of soundscapes. I work with several simultaneous ideas, which
        gradually deepen, receiving
        stimuli from the surrounding life. My working processes are long, so a
        work's arc from idea to a finished piece of work or installation may
        take several years. I like the slow
        maturation of the works, it is interesting but also a challenge, as the
        life surrounding us is very fragmented. One must be able to hold on and
        to let go when searching for the
        final direction and form of the works. I choose the material of the
        works depending on the idea, and works have been born from materials
        such as washing sponges, toasts, and
        coffee filters.</p>

    <p>In recent years, I have made a series of sound
        installations, to which I have attached sound and other material related
        to home. For several years now, my
        works have been dealing with the effect of being in a constant hurry to
        people's living environment.</p>

    <p>At the moment I am working in Berlin, Lahti and
        Helsinki.</p>

    <h3>All-rounder of Visual Arts Wakes Up The Audience<br/>
        <small>Artist introduction by Veikko Halmetoja (translated from Finnish
            by Mika Salminen)
        </small>
    </h3>
    <p>Laura Kärki creates images, words and sound. She is the visual artist,
        poet and sound designer of her own works. In addition to this, she is
        artisan who lets the technique and work process show in the works and be
        part of them.</p>

    <p>Versatility is a strength. Kärki searches her artistic direction from
        content, not esthetics. She has content first, then materials and
        finally form. Her works are created with technique that best supports
        the content. The form does not, however, get in the shadow of the
        content. Well chosen materials and techniques come to their own when
        they are in harmony with the content. The price Kärki pays from this is
        the lack of visual distinguishing characteristics.</p>

    <p>It makes harder to create an artist brand but brings more credibility. In
        her chosen way, the works speak from themselves, and she is left with
        time to think and deepen the content.</p>

    <p>Kärki is proficient in working with both ceramics and textile and
        utilizes her expertise in her works. She stiches sculptures, reproduces
        object collages as ceramics, and even makes photo print sculptures on
        fabric of customers' own pictures.</p>

    <p>Pill Days (2010) is ceramics. There contraceptive pill packagings are
        reproduced of traditional design material. The contradiction is
        delicious especially because the work is very beautiful. With a material
        choice, an everyday object having however controversial set of values
        has become an interesting statement.</p>

    <p>Stress Balls (2011) are big black pillows. They are gentle oddities
        stitched to form. Stress balls reach their many hands towards the
        viewer. Whether they are asking or giving help remains unanswered.</p>

    <p>Why Won't Anyone Play With Me? (2011) is a sad small sculpture, where
        many of Kärki's used techniques merge. The work stiched from a fabric
        print also has a soundscape. The girl in the print is Kärki herself, but
        that is not ultimately what matters. The work depicts children's
        feelings of loneliness in a general and recognizable way.</p>

    <p>Themes of alienation and feelings of being left out bind Kärki's works.
        Loneliness, friends and relatives forgotten in a hurry, and inability
        for empathy are all related to social problems of contemporary
        society.</p>

    <p>Kärki does not slack around but has the courage to comment against
        indifference. She teaches us to ask How Are You (2011) written with
        calligraphy taught in elementary school and gives out her poems within
        crumbled paper balls to read in the work Momentary Reliefs
        (2003-2011). Engagements (2010) is made of molten symbols of love, to
        which probably many who have experienced deception or break-ups can
        relate.</p>

    <p>The works are eloquent and force to think. They hold inside small cracks,
        that give out unscrupulous characteristics of the reality we all have
        accustomed to. Kärki is a topical visual artist, who does not respect
        boundaries. She has the courage to take expressive risks and because of
        this, her works are easily approachable. The works are experiential and
        rise emotions. That is a welcome and rare characteristic in this era of
        calculated expression.</p>
